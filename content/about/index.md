### AI disclaimer
Every word on this site comes straight from my brain to my fingertips – no AI ghostwriting here! I do, however, use AI as my digital proofreader to catch typos and smooth out awkward sentences. If something comes back sounding too robotic or just... _not me_, I scrap it and start over. And yes, I really do love my em dashes – they're everywhere in my daily writing!
